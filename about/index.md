This site is "just another website" that does not have any meaning.

More specifically, this site does have a few purposes:

1) To continue practicing my ability to make static pages

2) To continue practicing HTML, CSS, SCSS, and Jekyll

3) To show others the capability of Github Pages

You can do literally anything (non-dynamic) here. You can put a background image,
for instance.
